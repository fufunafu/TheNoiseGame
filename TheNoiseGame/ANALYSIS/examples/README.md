# MATLAB Analysis Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the analysis functions.

## Example Scripts

### example_analysis.m

A comprehensive example showing how to:
- Load noise game data from CSV
- Calculate performance metrics
- Run psychometric analysis
- Analyze reaction times
- Generate visualizations
- Export results

**Usage:**
```matlab
% Edit the filename in the script to point to your data
edit example_analysis.m

% Run the example
example_analysis
```

### quick_test.m

A quick test script for verifying the analysis pipeline is working correctly. Useful for:
- Testing after installation
- Debugging issues
- Quick verification of data format

**Usage:**
```matlab
% Edit to specify your test data file
edit quick_test.m

% Run the test
quick_test
```

## Creating Your Own Analysis Scripts

You can use these examples as templates for your own custom analyses:

```matlab
% 1. Start with the basic structure from example_analysis.m
% 2. Modify to include your specific analyses
% 3. Add custom visualizations or metrics as needed
% 4. Save your custom script in your own analysis directory
```

## Tips

- Keep example scripts simple and well-commented
- Use relative paths or prompt for file locations
- Include error handling for common issues
- Add inline documentation explaining each step
